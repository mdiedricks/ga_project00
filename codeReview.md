After reviewing my code I discovered a few things about my code that weren't initially obvious to me.

Firstly, having to explain my code to somebody else step by step made me question my methodologies a bit. I questioned the variable names and whether they were clear. I questioned the logic I used, and whether or not it was necessary.

Secondly, I became aware of unnecessary duplications in the variables I had created. During my coding process I built certain arrays and variables as placeholders to store data. However, at later stages they had become obsolete or duplicated. I was then able to remove that duplication. 

The part of my code I was most proud of was probably the arrangement and readability of my code. I think I take extra care to make sure I separate and group parts of my code so somebody else can find thigns easily within the code. I try to comment as much as is necessary so when i return I know what the code is doing.

The thing I would like to clean up more is the logic. I still believe my code to be too "wordy" and sometimes containing extra logic that could be refactored. I would liek to focus on the refactoring component more. Practice making code that is more concise at getting the job done.
