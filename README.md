## General Information
We all had to make a TicTacToe game, and I chose to build mine referencing the 8Bit style of 80s games.

The theme was an homage to games I played as a child, and speak to my enjoyment of the earlier development of video games and the accompanying style.

## Technology Used
Good old HTML, CSS and jQuery

## Project Status
This project was completed in week 6 of a 26 week course.
